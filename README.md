### EduAgent: Generative Student Agents in Learning


#### Dataset


##### To run the simulation

- Be sure to set your own OpenAI API key (line 18-19), Gemini API key (line 1198), and HuggingFace API key (line 1161) in agent_model_run.py
- Change configuration dictionary according to your own settings in agent_model_run.py
- run agent_model_run.py

#### To draw figures in the paper

More details are coming soon...




#### Warning

- Due to the massive contextual data as input, each agent simulation will cost about 0.2 USD with GPT 4 and 0.02 USD with GPT 3.5. Running the whole N = 310 agents for experiment one or N = 705 agents for experiment two will result in high cost. Therefore, be sure to set your suitable agent number.


#### TODO

- Some variables in the codes and datasets are not exactly the same as depicted in the paper. We will update them soon.
